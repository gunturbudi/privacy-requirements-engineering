# 🔒 Privacy Requirements Engineering Cheatsheet 🔒

## 1. 🎯 Defining Privacy Goals
   - **Regulation Requirements:** Analyze regulations, use KORA, Semantic Parameterization 📜
   - **Users, Stakeholders, Organization:** Workshops, interviews, questionnaires 👥
   - **Standards and Principles:** Systematic approach, structured interviews 📏
   
   **Work Products:** Specific privacy goals, traceability matrix, stakeholder goal tables 📊
   
   **Resources:** Regulatory documents, stakeholder feedback, privacy standards 📚

## 2. 🖥️ Characterizing the System  
   - **Elicit Functional Requirements:** Textual specifications, NLP techniques, questionnaires ✍️
   - **Asset and Data Inventory:** Data processing analysis, guided questionnaires, focus groups 🗃️
   - **Model-based Approach:** Data Flow Diagrams, STS-ml, UML, BPMN 🔀
   
   **Work Products:** Functional requirements list, assets and data inventory, system diagrams 📋
   
   **Resources:** Stakeholder goals, current database, data flow diagrams 💾

## 3. 🔍 Privacy Risks and Requirements Elicitation
   - **Privacy Impact Assessment:** Analytical queries, structured methodologies 🔎
   - **Privacy Threat Analysis:** Data Flow Diagrams, misuse cases, threat tree patterns 🕵️‍♂️
   - **Elicit Privacy Requirements:** Patterns, requirements templates, user interaction analysis 🗳️
   
   **Work Products:** PIA report, threat catalog, privacy requirements patterns 📝
   
   **Resources:** System documentation, common threats list, privacy goals, regulations 📜

## 4. 🚦 Prioritization and Validation
   - **Prioritization:** DREAD analysis, Analytical Hierarchy Process, stakeholder feedback 🏆
   - **Adjustment and Validation:** Stakeholder validation, scenario-based methods, Fagan inspection ✅
   
   **Work Products:** Prioritized threats, approved privacy requirements, formal requirements 📊
   
   **Resources:** Stakeholder expertise, validation rules, risk evaluation formula 🧮

## 5. 🛡️ Strategy and Solution Selection  
   - **Privacy Pattern and PET Selection:** Expert knowledge, mapping tables, semantic recommendations 🗺️
   - **Design Privacy-Aware Architecture:** Architecture tactics, enterprise patterns, approximation 🏰
   - **Organizational Measures:** Identification of privacy targets, standards assessment 🎯
   
   **Work Products:** Mapping of threats to PETs/patterns, compliance architecture, org measures 🗺️
   
   **Resources:** Privacy pattern/PET catalogs, reference architectures, ISO standards 📚

Just to remind you, this is an iterative process. Continuously engage stakeholders, reassess goals and risks, and adapt solutions as needed. 🔄 Automation tools can expedite tasks, but expert oversight remains crucial. ⚙️ Tailor this approach to fit agile methodologies by focusing on key privacy issues in each sprint while maintaining a holistic view.
